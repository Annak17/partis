- perfromance 
  - min occurences before you start averaging over alleles (& co)
    - tried with 5, 10, 20, 50 (or something like that) made minimal performance difference (...for whatever set of other parameters were in effect at that point)
  - few vs many genes
    - pulled out ~10 v and d genes at random (used all js) and ran on data, made sim, inferred on sim yadda yadda
    - relative performance of sw and hmm was pretty much the same

  - insertion and deletion dists are consistently a bit narrower for hmm
  - hmm consistently gets d and j correct (up to allele) a bit more than sw, but v they\'re both about 100 percent.
    - hmm\'s v_hamming_to_true_naive is more accurate, though, despite this
  - hmm\'s inferred mute freq is consistently a bit narrower (and less biased) than sw
    - note I wasn\'t really seeing this before... that may have/was probably because I was running performance on 10k rather than 50k seqs
  - even when insertion content is uniform over the bases, the hmm finds an excess of T and a deficit of A. no idea why.
    - same deal for SW, although looks like maybe the A deficit is spread among the other bases more evenly
    - this doesn\'t seem to reflect the underlying base distribution for the whole sequence
  - adding in insertion content doesn\'t seem to help significantly/at all, i.e. the hmm performs just as well with and without it. *sigh*
    - *but* adding it into *simulation* makes a solid difference -- both SW and HMM do better on simulated sequence where the inserts have non-uniform base content
