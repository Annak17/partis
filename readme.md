Partis is an HMM-based framework for B-cell receptor annotation, simulation, and partitioning.
It is built on top of the [ham](https://github.com/psathyrella/ham) HMM compiler, and also uses the [ighutil](https://github.com/cmccoy/ighutil) set of Smith-Waterman annotation tools.
Installation and usage instructions are [here](https://github.com/psathyrella/partis/blob/master/documentation.txt).
