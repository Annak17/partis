hmms
  - blast instead of s-w?
  - figure out what erick meant by non-negative matrix factorization
  - get connors s-w (vdjalign) running
  - don\'t forget to add gene version choice probs back in
  - add an initial step to determine which alleles and versions this individual actually has
  - add assertion in text parser that emission and transition probs at to 1.0
  - add probability of choosing a gene as an additional factor
  - how to choose the k_v k_d ranges to loop over? (probably smith-waterman)
  - optimizations
    - TODO in FillTrellis
    - for k_v --> k_v + 1, don\'t recalculate the whole table
    - use erick\'s idea for a smith-waterman cutoff for gene version plausibility
    - don\'t rerun the v region if you\'ve only changed k_d!
    - when we\'re doing pairs, it seems there should be some optimizations due to the fact we don\'t need to actually identify the gene versions, but only partition the sequences
    - even *within* one gene version\'s dp table, I\'m looping over a lot of states to which I can\'t transition. Does this matter? Can it be avoided?
    - alleles: save chunks of dp tables and reuse \'em
    - don\'t look at entire v gene
    - take vdj version length into account (if a huge and unlikely insertion or deletion is necessary, don\'t run it)
    - use correlation between vdj choices (eg if I chose v7 if I always choose j2, don\'t check all the other js)
    - would it be faster with STATE_MAX less than 1024?
    - only look at the likeliest gene versions at first (and don\'t look at alleles you know the person doesn\'t have?)
    - try fancier functions (viterbi, forward, etc) that were originally present
    - instead of one hmm for all v genes, have several (maybe one for each version?)
    - which k_v, k_d to loop over?
    - can I remove the '######' lines from .hmm files?
    - compress hmm files (well, deverbosify them)
    - don\'t use hmm files -- build the hmm directly in memory

  - double check his forward algorithm
  - make sure lexicalTable changes didn\'t screw up transition class
  - wait, what is stochhmm doing with the 'N's?
  - write something to convert hmm model files to diagrams for debugging purposes
  - add bfloats to stochhmm?
