hmms
  - if we assume that we\'re much *more* interested in large clusters than small clusters (say, maybe we only care that there are a lot of one-sequence clusters), then
    we could initially do all-against-all on some subset. Then, run each new sequence only against the larger clusters in this subset
  - need to get gene choice probs from *naive* and apply them to mature
  - the choices we make about which is the best reconstruction near the d/insertions is very dependent on how much mutation we think occurred
    - so try to use the amount of mutation in v to inform this decision
  - blast instead of s-w?
  - figure out what erick meant by non-negative matrix factorization
  - get connor\'s clustering algorithm working
  - don\'t forget to add in the denominator to normalize for individual sequence forward probs
  - add an initial step to determine which alleles and versions this individual actually has
  - add assertion in text parser that emission and transition probs add to 1.0
  - optimizations
    - add in cdr3 length partitioning
    - TODO in FillTrellis
    - for k_v --> k_v + 1, don\'t recalculate the whole table
    - when we\'re doing pairs, it seems there should be some optimizations due to the fact we don\'t need to actually identify the gene versions, but only partition the sequences
    - even *within* one gene version\'s dp table, I\'m looping over a lot of states to which I can\'t transition. Does this matter? Can it be avoided?
    - alleles: save chunks of dp tables and reuse \'em
    - don\'t look at entire v gene, i.e. look at less than we have in the reads
    - would it be faster with STATE_MAX less than 1024?
    - run HMM several times, the first maybe only on the single best gene versions and a narrow kset
    - try fancier stochhmm function versions (viterbi, forward, etc) that were originally present
    - can I remove the '######' lines from .hmm files?
    - compress hmm files (well, deverbosify them)
    - don\'t use hmm files -- build the hmm directly in memory

  - wait, what is stochhmm doing with the 'N's?
  - add bfloats to stochhmm?
