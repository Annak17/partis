### partis

partis is an HMM-based framework for B-cell receptor sequence annotation, simulation, and clonal family inference.
It is built on top of the [ham](https://github.com/psathyrella/ham) HMM compiler, and also uses the [ighutil](https://github.com/cmccoy/ighutil) set of Smith-Waterman annotation tools.

The following two papers describe the annotation and clonal family inference functionality of partis, respectively:
